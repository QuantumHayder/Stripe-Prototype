🚀 Stripe-Prototype
Welcome to the Stripe Prototype for my Software Engineering project — a mini version of a LinkedIn Clone payment module! 🎯
This repo is all about integrating Stripe to handle 💳 one-time payments using Checkout Sessions.

What's inside? 🔍
🧑‍💻 A User class with full CRUD operations

🛠️ A mock MongoDB setup to simulate database interactions

💸 Clean and simple Stripe payment flow setup

It's lightweight, fun, and built to test out Stripe magic! ✨
